I undertook Advent of Code for a bit of fun and to try my hand at learning Go. This was the first time I've
used Go and my first Advent of Code!

## What is Advent of Code?

_Excerpt from the Advent of Code [website](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about);_

    "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
    and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a
    speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or
    to challenge each other."

## Approach and resources
I used Advent of code as a way to challenge myself, learn a new language, and pick up some interesting algorithms on the way. I completed all the puzzles before the new year using resources including the
advent of code reddit page and hyper-neutrino to help me along where knowledge gaps appeared
